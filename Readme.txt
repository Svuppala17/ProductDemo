Have considered below assumptions as I am not able to open the att connect demo recording



In the requirement document , we need to add product related list also
	But in the demo screenshots, I am not able to see product detail page.

	Because of that have not included related list field in the user interface.



In the demo screenshots, I am able to see price, but it was not mentioned in the requirements. Have considered price as well.
In Home page, requirements mentioned as provide Add New product button and once product is added without refreshing page. need to update product list. In demo screenshots product list and add are in same page. As per demo screenshots, I included add new product, product list and update product in same page.
